# Galactic Recursion!!

The concept of storytelling has held a place of significance among AI researchers since the start of the field. For some game designers, a true “interactive story” is something of the Holy Grail of games. In an attempt to portray such a narrative order, we aim to present this novel narrative order, such that a unique path essentially constituted of the same events, can be played every time. The episodes represent different events from the character’s past, present, and future. An AI system will advance the narrative by choosing the next episode to visit based on the player’s in-game decisions.
